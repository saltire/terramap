This is a simple map generator for Terraria. It works with version 1.1.1.

It uses PIL to draw a colour representation of a Terraria world.

Instantiate a `World` object, passing it the path to the world file and the
data folder, respectively. Then call `draw_map()`, passing it the path to the
output file.

For an example, run `start.py`.
